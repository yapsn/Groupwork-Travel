# Project Blueprint: Smart Pharmacy Hub

## Project Overview

This project is a modern, framework-less web application for a "Smart Pharmacy Hub". It's designed to provide a one-stop solution for users who are feeling unwell and need quick access to medical consultations, medicine, and information. The website will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean, user-friendly, and accessible interface.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Landing Page:** A basic landing page with a hero section, services, and a footer.
*   **Intuitive Redesign:** A complete visual and structural overhaul with a dark theme, improved layout, and a more engaging, CRM-like user experience.

## Plan for Current Change: Add Functional Service Pages

To make the website functional, I will create separate HTML pages for each of the four core services. This turns the dashboard from a visual element into a functional navigation hub.

1.  **Update `index.html` Links:** The links in the dashboard cards on the homepage will be updated to point to the new, corresponding service pages.

2.  **Create Service Pages:**
    *   **`consultation.html`:** A page for "Virtual Consultation" featuring a form for users to describe their symptoms and request a consultation. This makes the service actionable.
    *   **`pharmacy.html`:** A page for the "Express Pharmacy" that includes a search bar for users to look up medications, simulating a real pharmacy search.
    *   **`finder.html`:** A page for the "Urgent Care Finder" containing a placeholder for an interactive map and a list of nearby clinics, providing a clear visual for finding care.
    *   **`emergency.html`:** A dedicated page for "Emergency Support" with large, easy-to-read emergency contact numbers and clear instructions, ensuring help is accessible quickly.

3.  **Update CSS and JavaScript:**
    *   New styles will be added to `style.css` to support the forms and new elements on the service pages, ensuring a consistent design.
    *   Each new HTML page will link to the existing `style.css` and `main.js` to maintain the visual theme and interactive scroll effects.
