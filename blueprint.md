# Project Blueprint: Smart Pharmacy Hub

## Project Overview

This project is a modern, framework-less web application for a "Smart Pharmacy Hub." It's designed to provide a one-stop solution for users who are feeling unwell and need quick access to medical consultations, medicine, and information. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean, user-friendly, and accessible interface.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Landing Page:** A basic landing page with a hero section, services, and a footer.
*   **Intuitive Redesign:** A complete visual and structural overhaul with a dark theme, improved layout, and a more engaging, CRM-like user experience.
*   **Functional Service Pages:** Dedicated, interactive pages for each of the core services: Virtual Consultation, Express Pharmacy, Urgent Care Finder, and Emergency Support.
*   **Google Analytics Integration:** Integrated Google Analytics with Measurement ID `G-Z8C0TRKG2W` across all HTML pages to track user behavior and website performance.
*   **Diagnostic Console:** A floating, toggleable console to display real-time logs and errors for debugging purposes.

## Plan for Current Change

**Request:** Enhance user engagement on the homepage.

**Status: In Progress**

**Plan:**
1.  **Transform Testimonials into an Interactive Carousel:** Convert the static "What Our Users Are Saying" section into a dynamic, auto-scrolling carousel to make the page more lively and engaging.
2.  **Add Navigation Controls:** Implement "Next" and "Previous" buttons to allow users to manually cycle through the testimonials.
3.  **Enhance Visuals:** Apply modern CSS styling to create a smooth sliding animation and ensure the navigation controls are intuitive and visually appealing.
4.  **Implement Carousel Logic:** Write the necessary JavaScript to manage the state of the carousel, handle automatic sliding, and respond to user interactions with the navigation buttons.
