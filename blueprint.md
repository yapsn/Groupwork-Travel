# Project Blueprint: Smart Pharmacy Hub

## Project Overview

This project is a modern, framework-less web application for a "Smart Pharmacy Hub." It's designed to provide a one-stop solution for users who are feeling unwell and need quick access to medical consultations, medicine, and information. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean, user-friendly, and accessible interface.
