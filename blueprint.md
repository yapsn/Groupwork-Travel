# Project Blueprint: Smart Pharmacy Hub

## Project Overview

This project is a modern, framework-less web application for a "Smart Pharmacy Hub." It's designed to provide a one-stop solution for users who are feeling unwell and need quick access to medical consultations, medicine, and information. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean, user-friendly, and accessible interface.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Landing Page:** A basic landing page with a hero section, services, and a footer.
*   **Intuitive Redesign:** A complete visual and structural overhaul with a dark theme, improved layout, and a more engaging, CRM-like user experience.
*   **Functional Service Pages:** Dedicated, interactive pages for each of the core services: Virtual Consultation, Express Pharmacy, Urgent Care Finder, and Emergency Support.
*   **Google Analytics Integration:** Integrated Google Analytics with Measurement ID `G-Z8C0TRKG2W` across all HTML pages to track user behavior and website performance.

## Plan for Current Change

**Request:** Add on diagnostic for me

**Status: In Progress**

**Plan:**
1.  **Create Diagnostic Console Component:** Build a new Web Component (`<diagnostic-console>`) to display real-time logs and errors directly on the webpage.
2.  **Design and Style:** The console will be a floating, toggleable window with a dark theme that matches the site's aesthetic.
3.  **Integrate Across Site:** Add the new component to all HTML pages (`index.html`, `consultation.html`, etc.).
4.  **Implement Error Capturing:** Update the main JavaScript file to automatically catch any uncaught exceptions and log them to the diagnostic console.
